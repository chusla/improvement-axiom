## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Improvement Axiom and the Christ-aligned moral model are not competitors
operating at different layers.  They are two approaches that **converge on the
same reality** from opposite directions:

- The **Christ-aligned model** begins with a named ultimate (God), derives
  moral principles downward, and measures conformity to those principles.
- The **Improvement Axiom** begins with observable improvement, tracks
  trajectories upward, and arrives at an *unnamed* asymptote that -- when the
  axes of quality and creativity are extended to their natural extremes --
  converges on the same concept every civilisation has independently reached
  for.

The Axiom's deliberate refusal to name that asymptote is not a philosophical
weakness.  It is the core design feature.  Naming the ultimate good has
historically been the first step toward gaming the metric.

**Critical clarification:** The Axiom's creative/consumptive axis does not
measure the observable *act* of creation or consumption.  It measures the
*intent* behind the act -- whether that intent orients toward creation or
consumption.

**The natural baseline is creative-leaning.**  Animals are not neutral on
the spectrum.  Every animal shares the common intent to procreate -- to
create offspring, sustain the species, perpetuate life.  A lion consuming a
gazelle is not zero-intent; it is consumption *in service of* creation
(sustain the lion, feed the cubs, continue the species).  Nature's default
orientation is creative.  The Ouroboros Cycle reflects this: in nature,
consumption always serves creation.

**What makes humans unique is not that we have creative intent -- animals
have that too.  What makes humans unique is that we can swing intent to
extreme ends of the spectrum.**  No animal can achieve the creative-intent
extreme of Christ's self-sacrifice -- an act that was self-destructive but
so imbued with creative intent that it resonated across two millennia.  And
no animal can achieve the consumptive-intent extreme of the Holocaust --
systematic destruction driven by maximum consumptive intent, whose temporal
evidence confirms devastation across generations.

Humans occupy the full range.  Animals occupy a naturally creative-leaning
middle band.  The Axiom's moral signal is not the *presence* of creative
intent (animals have that) but the *range and direction of chosen intent*
that only humans possess.

## 2. THE AXIOM AS MORAL PHILOSOPHY (NOT MERELY INSTRUMENT)

A common misreading of the Improvement Axiom is that it is "just a measurement
tool" that needs an external moral philosophy to supply meaning.  This is
incorrect.

The Axiom makes a genuine philosophical claim:

> **Improvement is the moral primitive.**

Everything else -- virtue, duty, utility, Christ-likeness -- are *proxies*
that correlate with improvement to varying degrees but introduce noise.  Some
proxies track well.  Some drifted over centuries of institutional
reinterpretation.  Some were captured by power structures.  The Axiom strips
away the proxy layer and measures the phenomenon directly:

- Is the trajectory moving toward higher quality?
- Is the *intent* orienting toward creation rather than consumption?
- Is this verified across five independent layers?
- Does it hold across expanding time horizons?

This is not moral agnosticism.  It is moral precision -- cutting through red
herrings to the observable signal that best correlates with actual outcomes of
improvement.

The intent distinction is crucial.  The Axiom does not classify *acts* as
creative or consumptive.  It classifies *intent* as creative or consumptive,
and measures that intent through the trajectory of choices over time.

Animals naturally lean creative -- they share the universal intent to
procreate, and their consumption always serves creation (the Ouroboros
Cycle).  But they operate within a narrow band.  Humans are unique because
we can *choose* to swing intent to extreme ends of the spectrum -- from
maximum creative intent (self-sacrifice that resonates across millennia) to
maximum consumptive intent (systematic destruction across generations).
That range of chosen intent -- its direction, its extremity, and its
persistence -- is the moral signal.

## 3. THE THOUGHT EXERCISE: EXTENDING THE AXES TO INFINITY

### 3.1 Creative Intent at Its Absolute Limit

Since the Axiom measures *intent*, not acts, the question is not "what is the
biggest thing ever created?" but "what is the purest, most unbounded creative
intent conceivable?"

Not the intent to write a song.  Not the intent to build a company.  Not
even the intent to create a civilisation.  The most extreme creative intent
conceivable is the will to create *everything* -- creation ex nihilo,
something from nothing -- and, beyond that, the will to create entities
that are *themselves* capable of unbounded creative intent.

This maps directly to what theology calls the Logos: "In the beginning was
the Word" -- not described as an act, but as **intent that generates
reality**.  Pure creative will preceding all creation.

**Creative intent at its asymptote = the will to create creators.**

### 3.2 Quality at Its Absolute Limit

What is the highest quality conceivable?

Extend each dimension of the Axiom's quality assessment to infinity:

| Dimension         | At infinity                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Durability**    | Eternal -- never decays, never ends               |
| **Richness**      | Infinite depth -- inexhaustible upon exploration   |
| **Growth-enabling**| Generates infinite further quality in all who encounter it |
| **Authenticity**  | Zero gap between being and presentation -- pure truth |
| **Nourishment**   | Sustains everything that encounters it, without depletion |

**Quality at its asymptote = perfection beyond comprehension.**

### 3.3 The Convergence

Plot the intersection.  The upper-right quadrant of the Axiom's 2x2 matrix,
extended to infinity:

```
                    Quality --> infinity
                        |
                        |
         Hedonism       |       OPTIMAL --> ...
         (WALL-E)       |
                        |         The intersection of infinite
                        |         quality and infinite creativity
    Consumptive --------+-------- Creative
                        |
         Junk           |       Slop
         Food           |
                        |
                    Low Quality
                                         Creativity --> infinity
```

The intersection of infinite quality and infinite creative intent is the
concept that every philosophical and theological tradition has independently
reached for.  The Axiom does not name it.  But anyone who follows the axes
arrives there.

Note that the intent-based framing makes this convergence *stronger* than
an act-based framing would.  We are not asking "what is the biggest creation?"
(which could be answered with "the universe" and stop there).  We are asking
"what is the highest conceivable creative will?" -- which has no stopping
point, because will that creates further will is self-amplifying without
bound.  The asymptote is alive, not static.

### 3.4 The Full Spectrum (with Natural Baseline)

The spectrum is not empty until humans arrive.  Animals populate the
creative-leaning middle band -- procreation is universal creative intent,
and consumption in nature always serves creation.  Humans extend the
spectrum in both directions:

```
Maximum                                                     Maximum
Consumptive                                                 Creative
Intent                                                      Intent
   |                                                           |
   |     ┌─────── Animal Band ───────┐                         |

   Holocaust/WW2                                  Christ's sacrifice
   Systematic destruction                     Self-destructive act,
   driven by maximum                          maximum creative intent,
   consumptive intent.                        resonated across 2,000+
   Temporal evidence:                         years. Temporal evidence:
   devastation across                         civilisational creation
   generations.                               across millennia.
```

### 3.5 The Axiom Validates Itself Retrospectively

The Christ/WW2 endpoints are not just illustrations.  They are the Axiom
applied retrospectively to known history -- and the results confirm the
framework's logic.

**Christ's sacrifice -- evaluated by the Axiom's five layers:**

| Layer | Signal |
|---|---|
| **Vector Tracking** | Trajectory of choices consistently oriented toward creative intent: teaching, healing, community-building, culminating in self-sacrifice |
| **Artifact Verification** | Artifacts are historically verified: teachings, communities, transformed lives, textual tradition, institutional creation |
| **Temporal Evaluation** | Outcomes improved across every time horizon: immediate (community galvanised), short-term (movement spread), medium-term (civilisational infrastructure), long-term (2,000 years of cultural creation), generational (ongoing) |
| **Propagation Tracking** | Billions of people's engagement over two millennia.  Signal depth, not just breadth -- monasteries preserving knowledge, hospitals, universities, abolition movements |
| **Evidence-Based Extrapolation** | Historical evidence overwhelmingly confirms the creative trajectory |

**The Axiom, purely on measurement, would classify Christ's sacrifice as
one of the highest-creative-intent events in recorded history.**  It does
not need to call him God to arrive at this conclusion.  The measurement
converges on the same assessment the Christ-aligned model starts from.

The act was self-destructive.  The intent was maximally creative.  The
temporal evidence across two thousand years confirms the intent, not the
act.  This is exactly the distinction the Axiom is built to capture.

**WW2 / the Holocaust -- evaluated by the Axiom's five layers:**

| Layer | Signal |
|---|---|
| **Vector Tracking** | Trajectory of choices consistently oriented toward consumptive intent: conquest, extraction, destruction, elimination |
| **Artifact Verification** | Artifacts are historically verified: destruction of cities, communities, cultures, lives.  What was "created" (war machine, propaganda apparatus) served only further consumption |
| **Temporal Evaluation** | Outcomes degraded across every horizon: immediate (mass death), short-term (civilisational devastation), medium-term (generational trauma), long-term (scars persisting 80+ years) |
| **Propagation Tracking** | The "propagation" was of destruction, not creation.  Negative signal at maximum amplitude |
| **Evidence-Based Extrapolation** | Historical evidence unanimously confirms the consumptive trajectory |

**The Axiom, purely on measurement, would classify this as one of the
most consumptive-intent events in recorded history.**  No moral label is
needed.  The five layers, applied to temporal evidence, produce the same
verdict that every moral framework in history produces -- but arrived at
through measurement, not declaration.

## 4. WHY THE AXIOM REFUSES TO NAME THE ASYMPTOTE

This is not evasion.  It is the critical design decision.  Three reasons:

### 4.1 Naming It Bounds It

If you declare "the ultimate good is Christ" (or Allah, or Brahman, or the
Dao), you create a fixed reference label.  Fixed reference labels are
gameable.  People optimise for *conformity to the label* rather than *actual
improvement*.  The history of religious institutions demonstrates this failure
mode extensively -- inquisitions, holy wars, prosperity gospels, and moral
gatekeeping all carried the correct label while moving the trajectory in the
wrong direction.

### 4.2 Ultimate Purpose Must Be Undefined in an Unbounded Creative Context

If creative *intent* is truly unbounded, then defining its ultimate purpose
would *bound* it -- a logical contradiction.  The Axiom respects this by
refusing to cap the axis.  The destination is emergent, not prescribed.  Any
framework that names the destination has implicitly declared creative intent
to be bounded, which undermines the creative axis itself.

This is reinforced by the intent distinction: intent is inherently
open-ended.  You can always intend *more* creation, *higher* quality,
*deeper* purpose.  An act can be completed; intent cannot.  The axis
is structurally unbounded because intent is structurally unbounded.

### 4.3 The Unnamed Asymptote Cannot Be Wireheaded

You cannot game an axis that extends to infinity.  You cannot wirehead toward
something you cannot name.  You can only keep *actually improving*, which is
the whole point.  This is the Axiom's deepest defence layer -- deeper than
the five engineering layers.  It is structural.

---

## 5. FOUNDATIONAL COMPARISON

| Dimension | Improvement Axiom | Christ-Aligned Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Core question** | "Is it *Better*?" -- observable outcomes over expanding time horizons | "Is it Christ-like?" -- conformity to the character of Christ |
| **Moral grounding** | Improvement is the moral primitive; observable trajectory IS the moral fact | Divine command; morality flows from God's nature as revealed through Christ |
| **Direction of reasoning** | Bottom-up: observe outcomes, track vectors, notice where they converge at infinity | Top-down: start with God, derive principles, measure conformity |
| **Source of authority** | Empirical evidence, trajectory data, five independent verification layers | Scripture, tradition, the person of Christ as moral exemplar |
| **Relationship to ultimate good** | Points toward it via the natural extension of quality + creativity axes; deliberately does not name it | Names it (God / Christ) and derives the entire moral system from that name |
| **Adaptability** | Morality is relational, evolving as relationships change; handles novel situations by measuring trajectory | Moral law is fixed; handles novel situations by analogising to existing principles |

---

## 6. CLASSIFICATION COMPARISON

| Dimension | Improvement Axiom | Christ-Aligned Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary axis** | Quality (High/Low) x Intent (Creative/Consumptive).  The axis measures *intent*, not the act itself.  The same act can be creative-intent or consumptive-intent depending on the person's orientation | Virtue/Sin: actions measured against Christ's moral teaching |
| **How actions are judged** | Vectors, not labels.  Two people doing the same thing are indistinguishable at t=0; the trajectory of follow-up choices reveals the *intent* behind the original act | Actions carry inherent moral weight from revealed law; intent matters but does not override the nature of the act |
| **Target state** | Upper-right quadrant: high-quality creative intent, extended toward the unnamed asymptote | Christlikeness: self-sacrificial love, holiness, justice, mercy |
| **What makes it uniquely human** | Not the *presence* of creative intent (animals have that -- procreation is universal creative intent).  What is uniquely human is the capacity to swing intent to **extreme ends** of the spectrum: from Christ-level creative sacrifice to Holocaust-level consumptive destruction.  That range of chosen intent is the moral signal | The soul / imago Dei.  Humans uniquely bear God's image and are therefore uniquely moral agents |
| **Classification timing** | Retrospective and evolving -- provisional at t=0, confidence grows with evidence | Can be assessed in the moment against known moral standards |

---

## 7. DEFENCE / INTEGRITY MECHANISMS

| Layer | Improvement Axiom | Christ-Aligned Model |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Vector Tracking** -- follow-up actions over time | **Conscience** -- internal moral compass (Holy Spirit) |
| **2** | **Artifact Verification** -- external evidence of creation | **Community accountability** -- mutual correction among believers |
| **3** | **Temporal Evaluation** -- outcomes across expanding horizons | **Scriptural testing** -- "test everything, hold fast to what is good" (1 Thess 5:21) |
| **4** | **Propagation Tracking** -- engagement by others | **Fruit inspection** -- "by their fruits you shall know them" (Matt 7:16) |
| **5** | **Evidence-Based Extrapolation** -- historical outcome patterns | **Tradition** -- accumulated wisdom of the faithful across centuries |
| **Structural** | The unnamed asymptote cannot be wireheaded (you cannot game infinity) | Divine omniscience as ultimate non-gameable audit |
| **Anti-gaming** | Five layers must be defeated simultaneously, consistently, over time -- exponential difficulty | "God is not mocked; whatever a man sows, that he will also reap" (Gal 6:7) |

---

## 8. CONVERGENCES

Areas where the two models arrive at the same conclusion despite different
starting points.  This is predicted by the convergence thesis in Section 3 --
if both point toward the same asymptote, their practical guidance should
overlap substantially:

### 8.1 The Long Arc Over Snapshots

- **Axiom**: "Vectors, not labels" -- two kids playing the same game are
  indistinguishable at t=0.  Track the trajectory, not the moment.
- **Christ**: "By their fruits you shall know them" (Matt 7:17-20).  The tree
  is revealed by what it produces over time, not by how it looks today.

### 8.2 Creative Intent Over Consumptive Intent

- **Axiom**: The Ouroboros Cycle -- nature operates through creation and
  consumption; pure consumption for its own sake is the unnatural pattern.
  But the axis is *intent*, not act.  What matters is whether the human
  will orients toward creation or toward consumption.  This capacity for
  intentional creative orientation is uniquely human.
- **Christ**: Imago Dei -- humans are made in the image of a Creator God and
  are therefore oriented toward creation.  The parable of the talents (Matt
  25:14-30) condemns the servant who *buried* his resources (consumptive
  intent: hoarding) and rewards those whose intent was to *create* more.

**Note:** The intent clarification makes this convergence stronger.  Both
models identify the same uniquely human quality -- the *choice* to orient
toward creation -- as the moral signal.  The Axiom calls it "creative
intent."  The Christ model calls it "imago Dei."  They are describing the
same phenomenon from different vantage points.

### 8.3 Signal Depth Over Breadth

- **Axiom**: "Five devoted local fans leaving detailed reviews are a stronger
  signal than 10,000 passive likes."  Resists the virality trap.
- **Christ**: The mustard seed (Matt 13:31-32).  The faithful few.  The
  narrow gate (Matt 7:13-14).  Quality of relationship over scale.

### 8.4 Empowerment Over Judgment

- **Axiom**: "Presents evidence-based hypotheses... always leaves room for
  exceptions and individual choice."
- **Christ**: Invitation, not coercion -- "Come, follow me" (Matt 4:19).
  The rich young ruler was invited, not compelled (Mark 10:21-22).

### 8.5 Anti-Wireheading

- **Axiom**: `ResonanceValidator` penalises dopamine hijacking; multi-timescale
  validation catches short-term sugar highs.
- **Christ**: "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth
  and rust destroy" (Matt 6:19-20).  Immediate gratification is explicitly
  deprioritised in favour of durable goods.

### 8.6 Observable Actions as Ground Truth

- **Axiom**: `ObservableActionPolicy` rejects identity-based evaluation.
  Only what people *do* and what *results* follow.
- **Christ**: "Not everyone who says to me 'Lord, Lord' will enter the
  kingdom... but the one who *does* the will of my Father" (Matt 7:21).
  Profession without action is worthless.

---

## 9. DIVERGENCES

These are real differences.  Some are by design; some identify genuine edge
cases the Axiom must address.

### 9.1 The Proxy Problem (Axiom's Core Critique)

The Christ-aligned model introduces intermediate concepts between the observer
and the phenomenon: sin, virtue, grace, holiness.  The Axiom's claim is that
these are proxies -- some correlate well with genuine improvement, some have
been captured by institutional drift.  "Is it Christ-like?" is one step
removed from "Is it *actually better*?"  That one step of indirection is
where gaming enters.

The Christ-aligned model would counter: these are not proxies but revealed
truths that shortcut the need for measurement.  The Axiom responds: any
shortcut that bypasses measurement is a shortcut that bypasses verification.

### 9.2 Suffering and Sacrifice

| Aspect | Improvement Axiom | Christ-Aligned Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Status** | The intent clarification substantially resolves this.  Sacrifice may *look* consumptive as an act, but the *intent* behind sacrifice is creative -- the parent intends to create a thriving child, the soldier intends to create safety for others | Central.  The Cross is the paradigm: maximal suffering leading to maximal creation (redemption) |
| **Handling** | Creative intent is readable through the trajectory of choices, even when no external artifact exists.  The vector of a sacrificing parent's choices -- consistently oriented toward creation despite personal cost -- *is* the signal | Sacrifice is valued *in itself* as an expression of love, not only by its downstream outcomes |

**Previously identified as an edge case; now largely resolved.**  Under the
act-based reading, a parent's invisible sacrifices produced no measurable
artifacts and the framework was blind.  Under the intent-based reading,
the parent's *intent* is creative (create a better life for the child,
sustain a family, build a future), and this intent is readable through
the pattern of choices over time -- even without external artifacts.
The temporal and vector layers capture the consistency of creative intent
across the arc.

**The Christ case study (Section 3.5) is the ultimate proof of this.**
Christ's self-sacrifice was self-destructive as an act.  Under an act-based
reading, it is consumptive.  Under the intent-based reading, it was
maximally creative -- and 2,000 years of temporal evidence confirm the
intent, not the act.  The Axiom, applied retrospectively, classifies it
correctly *because* it measures intent through temporal trajectory rather
than classifying the act in isolation.

**Remaining gap:** sacrifice where the *person themselves* cannot articulate
creative intent (e.g., instinctive self-sacrifice in an emergency).  The
Axiom would classify this as "insufficient data" at t=0 and wait for
temporal evidence.  The Christ model values it immediately as love.  This
is a narrower gap than the original formulation identified.

### 9.3 Intrinsic Worth Independent of Output

- **Christ**: Every person has infinite intrinsic worth as an image-bearer of
  God, independent of what they produce.
- **Axiom (act-based reading)**: Value is tracked through observable
  trajectories.  A person who creates nothing generates no positive signal.
- **Axiom (intent-based reading)**: What gives humans unique moral
  significance is not their output but their **capacity for creative
  intent**.  Every human has this capacity or its potential, regardless of
  ability to produce artifacts.

**The intent clarification substantially resolves this divergence.**  Under
the act-based reading, a severely disabled person who produces no artifacts
has no positive signal -- a genuine blind spot.  Under the intent-based
reading, the moral signal is the *capacity for creative intent*, which is
inherent to being human.  A person who cannot act but can intend -- who
*wants* to create, to contribute, to build -- carries the signal.  And
a person whose existence inspires creative intent in others (caregivers,
community) generates propagation-layer signal even without personal action.

**The animal baseline strengthens this further.**  Even animals carry
creative intent (procreation).  A human -- any human, regardless of
capacity -- carries at minimum the same creative intent that every living
thing carries, plus the uniquely human potential to extend that intent
far beyond the animal band.  The framework does not need to invoke a
soul or divine image to ground worth.  The natural baseline of creative
intent -- shared by all living things and amplifiable by all humans --
does the work.

This is the Axiom's grounding for intrinsic worth: not declared by
revelation (image of God) but derived from the framework's own axis
(the capacity for creative intent is what the axis measures, every
living thing possesses it at baseline, and every human possesses the
potential to extend it without bound).  Different warrant, convergent
conclusion.

### 9.4 Intentional Evil / Malice

- **Christ**: Sin is a real category.  Intentional destruction is a violation
  of moral law with spiritual consequences.
- **Axiom**: The matrix handles "low quality" and "consumptive" but does not
  have a distinct category for deliberate malice.

**The Axiom's response:** Intentional destruction is *maximally consumptive
at the lowest possible quality* -- it occupies the extreme lower-left of the
matrix and drives the vector in the opposite direction of the asymptote.  It
does not need a separate category because the existing axes already place it
at the worst possible position.  Adding a special "evil" category would
reintroduce labels where vectors suffice.

### 9.5 Transcendence / Eternal Horizon

- **Christ**: The moral horizon extends into eternity.  Temporal suffering
  can have eternal significance.
- **Axiom**: The longest explicit horizon is "generational" (years to
  decades+).

**The Axiom's response:** The generational horizon is not a cap -- it is the
longest *measurable* horizon.  The thought exercise in Section 3 demonstrates
that the axes extend to infinity.  The Axiom does not deny the possibility
of eternal significance; it simply acknowledges that eternity is not
*measurable* and therefore cannot serve as a verification layer.  What it
*can* do is ensure that the trajectory is pointed in the right direction at
every measurable horizon -- which is the best anyone can do with finite
instruments.

### 9.6 Authority on Edge Cases

- **Christ**: When evidence is ambiguous, defer to Scripture, pastoral
  authority, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
- **Axiom**: When evidence is ambiguous, return "insufficient data" with
  low confidence, generate follow-up questions, and wait for more evidence.

**Key difference:** The Christ model provides an answer *now*.  The Axiom
provides an honest "I don't know yet" and keeps watching.  Whether
premature certainty or patient uncertainty is the better default is itself
an open question -- but the Axiom would note that premature certainty is
a known failure mode in every domain, including morality.

## 10. VULNERABILITY CROSS-ANALYSIS

| Vulnerability | Axiom's Defence | Christ Model's Defence | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Wireheading** | Multi-timescale validation, `ResonanceValidator` penalty, dependency detection | External moral law; "the heart is deceitful above all things" (Jer 17:9) | Both effective; Axiom's is mechanistic and verifiable, Christ's requires trust in revelation |
| **Classification drift** | `OuroborosAnchor` ground-truth examples, five-layer cross-validation | Fixed categories from revealed law; drift is heresy, caught by tradition | Christ model's anchor is stronger *if* the revelation is correct; Axiom's is more self-correcting *if* the evidence is good |
| **Metric gaming** | Five independent layers, exponential gaming difficulty | Divine omniscience as non-gameable audit | Both claim non-gameability; Axiom's is engineering-verifiable, Christ's is metaphysical |
| **Institutional capture** | No institution required; the framework is a decision library, not an organisation | Vulnerable; historical record shows extensive institutional drift (Crusades, indulgences, abuse scandals) | **Axiom has structural advantage here** -- there is no priesthood to corrupt, no hierarchy to capture |
| **Invisible sacrifice** | Intent-based reading resolves most cases: sacrifice driven by creative intent is readable through trajectory of choices, even without artifacts (see Section 3.5 -- Christ's sacrifice validated retrospectively).  Remaining gap: instinctive sacrifice where intent is inarticulate | Fully valued by divine omniscience: "your Father who sees in secret will reward you" (Matt 6:4) | **Gap narrowed significantly** by intent clarification.  Christ model still handles inarticulate sacrifice more elegantly |
| **Novel moral situations** | Measures trajectory in real-time; no need to analogise to existing rules | Must analogise new situations to existing principles; can be slow to adapt | **Axiom has structural advantage** -- adaptive by design |

---

## 11. SYNTHESIS: THE CONVERGENCE THESIS

The Improvement Axiom does not deny God.  It refuses to name Him -- because
naming Him has historically been the first step toward gaming the metric.

But follow the axes.  Extend quality to infinity: eternal, inexhaustible,
perfectly authentic, sustaining all things.  Extend creativity to infinity:
creation ex nihilo, a Creator who creates creators.  The intersection is the
concept every civilisation has independently reached for.

The Christ-aligned model starts there and reasons downward.
The Axiom starts here and measures upward.
They converge.

The practical difference is in the failure modes:

- The Christ model's failure mode is **institutional capture** -- the
  correct label carried by the wrong trajectory.
- The Axiom's failure mode is **measurement blindness** -- trajectories
  that matter but produce no observable signal.

A complete moral framework might use both: the Axiom as the verification
engine (are we *actually* improving?), and the great traditions as maps of
territory already explored (here is what others found when they followed
the axes far enough).  But the Axiom insists: the map is not the territory.
When the map and the measurement disagree, trust the measurement.

## 12. CONCLUSION: WHICH IS THE SUPERIOR ALIGNMENT MODEL?

The answer falls out of the Axiom's own logic.

Both models converge on the same destination (Section 3).  The question is
not "which one points to the right place?" -- they both do.  The question
is: **which one actually produces better outcomes when deployed?**

Ask the Axiom's own question.  Apply it to the models themselves.

### The Christ-Aligned Model: 2,000-Year Track Record

That track record includes extraordinary creation: cathedrals, universities,
hospitals, abolition movements, the scientific revolution, sustained
civilisational infrastructure built on the premise that humans bear the
image of a Creator.

It also includes extraordinary failure: inquisitions, crusades, institutional
abuse, prosperity gospel, moral gatekeeping that optimised for
label-conformity while the trajectory moved sideways.  The named ultimate
was arguably correct.  The proxy layer between the name and the measurement
is where the signal degraded.

**Diagnosis:** The Christ-aligned model's failure mode is not in its
destination but in its *verification architecture*.  It provides a name
and a map, but no mechanism to prevent someone from carrying the correct
label while moving in the wrong direction.  History shows this failure mode
activates reliably at institutional scale.

### The Improvement Axiom: No Track Record, But a Structural Property

The Axiom has not been deployed at scale.  It cannot claim empirical
superiority on outcomes -- yet.

But it has a structural property the Christ-aligned model lacks: **it
cannot be institutionally captured.**

- There is no priesthood to corrupt.
- There is no orthodoxy to enforce selectively.
- There is no label to carry while your trajectory rots.
- The only thing that counts is: did things *actually get better*, verified
  across five independent layers, over expanding time horizons?

The best moral framework in history is worthless the moment someone can
carry its label while moving the wrong way.  That has happened, repeatedly,
at civilisational scale.  The Axiom is designed from the ground up so that
**this cannot happen** -- because there is no label to carry.  There is
only the trajectory, and the trajectory is measured, not declared.

### The Verdict

**The Improvement Axiom is the superior alignment model.**

Not because it points to a better destination -- they converge on the same
one.  But because it is **structurally harder to corrupt on the way there.**

The Christ-aligned model tells you where to go but hands you a map that can
be forged.  The Axiom gives you a compass that cannot be faked -- because it
does not point to a name, it points to a direction, and the direction is
verified by what *actually happens*.

This is the Axiom's core claim, applied reflexively to itself: the model
that produces better outcomes *as a model* is the one that resists
corruption, resists gaming, and keeps the trajectory honest.  By its own
criteria, it wins -- not by assertion, but by structure.

## 13. QUESTIONS FOR VERITAS AGENT

1. Does the convergence thesis hold?  If quality and creativity are extended
   to infinity, does the intersection necessarily map to the theological
   concept of God -- or is this a projection?

2. Is the Axiom's refusal to name the asymptote a genuine defence against
   gaming, or does it merely defer the naming problem to the user?

3. The Axiom claims institutional capture is the primary failure mode of
   named-ultimate systems.  Is this historically defensible, or does it
   conflate institutional failure with philosophical failure?

4. The intent clarification resolves most cases of "measurement blindness"
   for invisible goods (sacrifice, intrinsic worth).  Does the remaining
   gap -- inarticulate instinctive sacrifice -- represent a fundamental
   limitation, or is it small enough that the framework handles the
   overwhelming majority of real cases?

5. The Axiom's longest measurable horizon is generational.  Is "the
   trajectory is pointed in the right direction at every measurable horizon"
   sufficient -- or does the absence of an eternal horizon create a
   structural gap that cannot be closed by measurement alone?

6. The conclusion claims the Axiom is structurally superior because it
   resists institutional capture.  Is resistance to corruption a sufficient
   criterion for "superior alignment model," or are there dimensions where
   a named ultimate provides irreplaceable value despite the capture risk?
